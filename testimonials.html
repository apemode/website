          <p class="mb-0">Our youth soccer team has been training with Antonios for the past month. His training sessions are challenging, fun, and most importantly soccer related. Our sessions consist of functional movements that soccer players complete during a match (sprints with changes of direction, jumps, agility, etc.). We also work on improving core, leg, and upper body strength as well as flexibility/mobility and injury prevention.</br></br>

          Antonios is constantly pushing and motivating the players to surpass their perceived limitations. The boys
          have noticeably gained a lot of self-confidence and increased their team spirit and camaraderie in the past
          month.</br></br>

          His experience as a professional player helps players understand all aspects of an athlete's lifestyle such as
          nutrition, rest, and mentality.</br></br>

          The team is always looking forward to each session.</br></br>

          I recommend Antonios for any club, coach, or athlete that wants to take their game to the next level.</p>

          <p class="mb-0">Antonios is by far the best personal trainer I have ever had. He is challenging and
            motivating. He pushes me beyond my limit. I highly recommend Ape Mode Fitness if you are looking for results

          <p class="mb-0">I’ve had personal trainers in the past, but never trained consistently or felt motivated
            enough to continue. I’ve been active all my life and consider myself healthy and fit, but I recently felt
            like I hit a plateau and decided I really wanted to push myself to get stronger and leaner. </br></br>I came
            across
            Ape Mode on Instagram, and am so happy I reached out. I’ve only been training with him for a couple months,
            and I can already see and feel big changes in my body. I’ve honestly never had so much fun training, and
            look forward to my early morning sessions every week!</br></br>Best trainer I’ve ever had, would highly
            recommend
            Antonios @ Ape Mode Fitness.</p>
